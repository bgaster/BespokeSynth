# Audio Anywhere

This is a modifided version of Bespoke Synth to support Audio Anywhere modules. 

Audio Anywhere is a framework for working with audio plugins that are compiled once and run anywhere. At the heart of Audio Anywhere is an audio engine whose Digital Signal Processing (DSP) components are written in Faust and deployed with WebAssembly. 

Details about the project can be found on the [project's homepage](https://muses-dmi.github.io/projects/).


# Bespoke Synth
A software modular synth that I'm building for myself, and you can use it if you want to. If you're interested, you can find some out of date documentation at https://www.reddit.com/r/BespokeSynth, or you can just jump in and start messing around.

You can find the most recent builds for Mac/Windows/Linux at https://github.com/awwbees/BespokeSynth/releases. To find the download, expand the "Assets" dropdown under the latest release.

### Notes
Some context: this is my home project that I've been working on since 2011 and has grown and sprawled like weeds. It has served as a learning platform for me, which means that some of it was written by my mediocre 2011 self, some of it is written by my hopefully-less-mediocre today self, and other parts were written at various levels of my mediocrity in between. It has many modules, some of which I haven't touched in years, some of which are likely hugely broken.

These days, I only get an hour or two every few nights to work on Bespoke. It's hard to take that short amount of time and devote it to bugfixing, instead I prefer to add new features and modules. As a result, bugs can get left in the wake and some of the modules stay half-finished. Most of the bugfixing I do happens when a bug directly gets in the way of me using the software, rather than any proactive bug-chasing. I think this process is important, to keep Bespoke as my fun little zen garden, rather than a chore that I will eventually abandon.

Any releases I put up will have bugs and stability issues with some of the modules, but that seems better than never doing any releases at all. I can't currently see a future where a fully-stable and mostly-bug-free release would happen... maybe when I retire. Watch this space in 2050!
